# flightsim-aircraft-panel

[Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) aircraft panel for touchscreens using [FSUIPC WebSocket Server](http://fsuipcwebsockets.paulhenty.com/).

**!!! THIS IS A PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT !!!**<br>
Only relevant for you if you are a programmer and know what you are doing. You are welcome to take a look and do pull requests if you have
any suggestions for improvement.
Eventually it will be more polished and well documented so that anyone can set it up.

You're welcome to take a look at my online services at [aviation.allanville.com](https://aviation.allanville.com/).

## Requirements

- A browser! (only tested with Chrome)
- [Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) or any flight simulator supported by FSUIPC
- [FSUIPC7](http://fsuipc.com/) (free)
- [FSUIPC WebSocket Server](http://fsuipcwebsockets.paulhenty.com/) (free)
- Preferably a touchscreen monitor!

## What is this?

The idea is to have a touchscreen with a browser window where you can easily click buttons, turn knobs etc in your aircraft
when you don't want to use the mouse and don't have a hardware panel.
You can also monitor other values from your aircraft.
This uses [FSUIPC](http://fsuipc.com/) and is limited to its capabilities.

Nothing speaks better than a visualization - this is a simple example screen:
